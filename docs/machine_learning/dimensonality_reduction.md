Dimensonality Reduction
========================

- Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is a technique that represents a high dimensional dataset as a low dimensional dataset with minimal information loss.
- DR is an important part of the machine learning pipeline as well. There are multiple reasons why we should do dimensionality reduction, such as, 
  - We want to reduce the storage space of the dataset.
  - We want to process the dataset faster, due to smaller memory constraint.
  - We want to visualize the data for better understanding.
- At a high level, DR is of two types, 
  - Extractive DR: where we reduce the dimensions by selecting the most important features.
  - Abstractive DR: where we reduce the dimensions by creating new features altogether.
